        <h2>Made from scratch with spinach pasta sheets </h2>
        <p>You won’t believe this is a meatless lasagna.  Made using a variety of fresh and dried mushroom for that incredibly tasty reduced ragu flavour.  Vegetarians and meat lovers will love this.</p>
        <p>Cooking it slow for a long time is the secret, so don’t skip that step. This recipe is totally made from scratch but of course you can cut corners.  Buy ready made pasta sheets and use a food processor.  Most of the effort goes into the ragu, and by using a food processor, the mushroom ragu can be made in 15 minutes, plus cooking time.  You can make the bechamel in 15 minutes or less.  If you chose to make the spinach pasta from scratch, it’s totally worth it and will take you longer.  So why not make extra and freeze the sheets ready for next time.  Any left over pasta sheets can also be sliced into a fettucine.</p>
        <p>When baking, you may need a little longer depending on your oven. Crispy edges are delicious but don’t over cook it unless you want to eat it all straight away. Otherwise it can be over crispy once reheated.   Once cooled and refrigerated, slice it up and make portions, reheat in oven from cold for about 30 minutes.  The corners will be crispy and delicious. Enjoy my spinach lasagna with mushroom ragu.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol> <p>For the Ragu</p>
            <li>Add the red wine to your dried mushrooms.  Set aside.</li>
            <li>Chop the vegetables finely using a knife or a food processor.  To a large pot or Dutch oven on high heat, add 4 tbsp olive oil, chopped onions, carrots and celery.  Mix and sweat vegetables.  Add the chopped mushrooms, chopped hydrated dried mushrooms, oregano, rosemary, garlic cloves, tomato paste, canned tomatoes, wine from mushrooms, salt and pepper.  Turn heat to very low and leave to reduce 90 to 120 minutes.  You can cover it, or add water if it becomes to dry.  Once reduced nicely, add the freshly chopped basil.  Taste and adjust for seasoning and set aside to cool down.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><p>For the Pasta Sheets</p>
            <li>In a large frying pan on high heat, add 2 tbsp olive oil and the spinach leaves.  Cook until wilted, approx. 30 seconds.  Turn off heat and leave to cool.  Spread out a clean kitchen cloth on your work area, place half the cooked spinach, fold tightly and wring out all the juices.  Repeat step. The dryer the better.</li>
            <li>To a blender add the eggs, and the cooked spinach.  Blitz until smooth.  Place the flour on your bench or in a large plate, create a well in the centre and pour in the spinach mixture.  Using a fork, mix until roughly mixed then finish by kneading by hand for approx. 10 minutes or until very smooth.  Cover in cling film and refrigerate 30 minutes or longer before use.</li>
            <li>Remove from fridge and cut in three even sizes. Flatten using the palm of your hand until you have three flat oval discs. Lightly dust one with flour. Cover the other discs with cling film until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Set the machine thickness dial to 0 or to wide. The two rollers should be fully open. Feed the pasta disk into the rollers as you turn the crank in a clockwise direction. Fold the pasta in half and give it a light dust. Feed it back into the machine several times until the pasta has a long rectangular shape.</li>
            <li>Cut the pasta sheet in two, dust with flour and feed through the rollers one thickness number increment at a time until you reach the desired thickness. For lasagna, you want a little thicker. On my machine I use number 5 or 6. Chose the thickness that suits you but remember that pasta sheets will expand in size when cooked.</li>
            <li>To cook the pasta, simply bring a large amount of water to the boil, and add sufficient salt. It should taste a little less salty than sea water, so don’t just put a pinch in or it won’t be enough. Drop the pasta into the boiling or simmering water, usually when it floats it’s close to being ready. Approx. 90 seconds depending on thickness. Remember it will still cook a little further in oven.  Remove from water and place over clean cloth kitchen towels to cool and dry.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><p>For the Bechamel</p>
            <li>Add to a saucepan the milk, place on heat until it starts to simmer.  Or heat in microwave, hot but no need to boil.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in separate pot.  Add flour to melted butter and mix with wooden spoon until it becomes a sandy texture.  Cook it for a couple minutes on low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the hot milk a little at a time and whisk vigorously each time.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes on very low heat (do not let burn on bottom). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Grate a little nutmeg (very small amount).  Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><p>For Lasagna Assembly and Baking</p>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, you will need a baking dish with high sides.  Line the bottom with the bechamel the place 4 cooked pasta sheets, you can overlap them.</li>
            <li>Place a large spoon full of ragu over each sheet and spread it out, not too thick.  Do the same with the bechamel then scatter grated Parmesan cheese.  Repeat this step 4 or 5 more times.  Pasta, ragu, bechamel, cheese.  Finish the top with remaining bechamel (thicker layer) and grated cheese Bake in oven for 30 min at 350°F – 180°C or until you have a slight crisp around the edges.  Once cooked, leave to cool 30 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
